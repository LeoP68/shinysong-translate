This project is a toolset to translate *IDOLMASTER SHINY COLORS: Song For Prism* to English. It includes a few scripts to patch the game using these tools.  
It accomplishes this by modifying the localization file and Unity assets, aided additionally with dll hijacking through [scsp-localify].

Guides for install and use can be found [below](#setting-up--getting-started).

This is based on the DMM version of the game and *should* work on linux and mac too, with some limitations.
